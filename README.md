# NMPB.Client

This is a decompilation of NMPB.Client.dll. It was decompiled with JetBrains dotPeek.

This decompilation is currently not recompilable due to some compiler-specific fields that need names. If anyone is willing to help, by all means, submit a pull request or two.

At this time, I do not want to add any other NMPB DLLs to this repository.

Eventually, I want to use NMPB without the GUI to create a headless server version.

## About NMPB

NMPB is a MIDI player bot for Multiplayer Piano. It is fairly old and will not connect to MPPClone-ish servers because it does not have any idea how to use the updated protocol.

NMPB is really decent and playing MIDIs and is decently capable of playing Black MIDIs and Impossible Piano songs.
